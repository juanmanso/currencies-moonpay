# üì¶ My Expo Repo

This repository contains the code for my Expo project reliving the pair programming exercise for today's meeting with Moonpay. It is built using React Native and Expo to make development faster.

As a follow-up to the interview, I tried to make the repo look as similar as possible to the latest state of the one of the exercise. Then I worked on it to improve with the things I think could be better.

I am excited about the potential collaboration with Moonpay and look forward to further discussions regarding this project and other opportunities.
